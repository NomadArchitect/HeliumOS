# Priority 1
I'm lazy to fill this one as there is a lot

# Priority 2
Move docs to Wiki?

# No Priority
Port to more compilers(ugh)
Port to more architectures(Will move to priority 2 or 1 with time)

# Other
You might also look at source files for `// TODO:` or `// FIXME:`(more priority here)
An IDE extension might help with finding those quickly
