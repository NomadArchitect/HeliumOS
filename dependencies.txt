Helium on its own does not depend on anyting, however, the tools that are automatically compiled with helium do have
build dependencies:

binutils/gcc build dependencies:
    - bison
    - flex
    - gmp
    - mpc
    - mpfr
    - texinfo
mkbootimg build dependencies:
    - zip

*Depending on how lazy I am* I might have implemented a ´make dependencies´ target to install these automatically
