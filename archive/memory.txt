Physical manager:
 - For each continuous free entry in the memory map, we store a header at the beginning that stores the following:
    * Pointer in physical address space to the memory region they are bookkeeping (8 bytes)
    * size of the memory region they are bookkeeping(in pages)                    (8 bytes)
    * size of the header(in pages)                                                (8 bytes)
    * index of first free 8-pages(only ne needs to be free )                      (8 bytes)
    * bitmap of the memory region they are bookkeeping                            (region_size / 4096 / 8)
   So the total size of the header in pages(as given by the field in the header itself) should be about:
     4*8 + region_size / 4096 / 8
