Physical manager:
  - After all usable memory is detected, a big enough portion is allocated that contains an array of:
    - A header pointing to a physical usable memory region(pointer & size)
    - A bitmap: Each page has a bit, if it is set, then it is a free page, if the bit is clear, the page is used
  The above is referred to as the physical memory manager struct, and when virtual memory is setup, it should be mapped
  to a specific address(not defined yet)
Virtual memory manager:
  - The virtual memory manager uses the same CPU structures to manage the virtual address space, as such it doesnt take any additional space or need any additional setup
Kernel heap:
