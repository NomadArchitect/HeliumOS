use the suffix _size for variables holding the size of a structure in bytes
use the suufix _len for variables holding the length of a structure in elements unit

use _off for variables holding the offset from a pointer in bytes
use _idx for variables holding the index from a pointer in elements units

As a general rule(but not always true), with ESIZE the size of an element:
    %_size = %_len * ESIZE
    %_off = %_idx * ESIZE
