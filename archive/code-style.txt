use the suffix _size for variables holding the size of a structure in bytes
use the suufix _len for variables holding the length of a structure in elements unit

use _off for variables holding the offset from a pointer in bytes
use _idx for variables holding the index from a pointer in elements units

As a general rule(but not always true), with ESIZE the size of an element:
    %_size = %_len * ESIZE
    %_off = %_idx * ESIZE


Use #include <*> instead of "*" whenever possible

Order #include from longest line to shortest line

Separate #includes that include a file directly from those that include files inside a folder
  Put those that include a file directly first
  Example: even if asm/scas.h is longer than mem.h
    we would still #include <mem.h> then #include <asm/scas.h>
    #includes which have folders are separated with a line from other #includes
