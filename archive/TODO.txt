In this file, I write anything that I should do in the near future, but don't have to/can't rn:

- faster framebuffer writes on real hardware, turns out plotting pixel by pixel is a bad idea for real framebuffers
  It works just fine in qemu, so no pressure
- Disable all AP cores, until we enable them again with a kernel module(Still lots of work to be done)
- Turn all(most) for loops into while loops, they just look better tbh
- Reuse the memory taken by bootboot's identity paging
- Make page invalidation inter processor proof(after multi processing is enabled)
