In this file, I write anything that I should do in the near future, but don't have to/can't rn:

- Turn all(most) for loops into while loops, they just look better tbh
- Reuse the memory taken by bootboot's identity paging
- Make page invalidation inter processor proof(after multi processing is enabled)
